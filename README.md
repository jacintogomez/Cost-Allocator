# Cost-Allocator

This is a payment allocator designed to address splitting costs among individuals. The application takes in user names and amounts and outputs step by step instructions on how to make all payments equal. For example, let's say John spends $75, Hannah spends $86, Sam spends $125 and Kate spends $85, and we want to equilibrate all costs. The program outputs that John must give Sam $17.75, Hannah give Sam $6.75, and Kate give Sam $7.75. Then in the end everyone will have an average of around $92.75 (rounding can make it slightly off).
